# Water-Chloroform-Simulations

This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the immiscible water-chloroform system using all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations. We systematically investigate the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of both
the pure and mixed phases to elucidate the fundamental forces governing their behavior. Our solvation free energy
calculations reveal that both water and chloroform molecules exhibit a strong preference for self-association, with
cross-solvation energies being significantly less favorable than self-solvation. This is the primary thermodynamic
driving force behind the systemâ€™s immiscibility, a finding corroborated by our calculation of a positive excess entropy of
mixing. At a structural level, our analysis confirms that within the Gibbs Dividing Surface (GDS), water molecules are
more ordered and coordinated than chloroform molecules. This interfacial organization, in turn, influences the dynamics
of the system, as evidenced by a longer dipole correlation time for water and a decrease in the diffusion coefficients
for both components in the mixture compared to their pure counterparts. Our findings for key properties, including the
density of states and diffusion coefficients, are in good agreement with available experimental and computational data,
validating our approach. This study provides a fundamental, multi-faceted description of the water-chloroform mixture,
which can serve as a valuable reference system for understanding physicochemical phase separation.
